Made to be used with models [ripped from WWE2K](https://rentry.org/wsebr) into [Blender 2.79](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-79/) for use with [PES FMDL Blender](https://github.com/the4chancup/pes-fmdl-blender)

# Usage

From there, the process is very similar to [KoikatsuToPES](https://github.com/MFGood/KoikatsuToPES#Usage).
